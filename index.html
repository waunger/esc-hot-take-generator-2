                "How did this not make it? Arguably the most Eurovision song of them all, with the exception of a couple others. I know it wasn't for everyone but it really threw me through a look because he really did amazing with the performance and imo (plus charisma, stage use, props, etc..)",
                "I feel like it might be because the staging was not 100% as good as the music video. I looooved the song and would've loved to see it in the final but even I was a bit disappointed about what they did on stage - it just fell a bit short after the super fun mv :(",
                "The only good thing about this semifinal was the clock song at the end.",
                "Call me crazy but I think this song gets top 5 in the grand final 😭😭😭.",
                "😬 Sorry guys but now that I've listened and replayed all of the songs, I've started to not like it. I know it's close to his heart but the way they webs their lyrics sound so generic. Their voice just grates me sometimes across the song, too, especially at the repeated part.",
                "This would've won if it had been in Swedish.",
                "JUSTICE FOR THIS SONG! SOOOOOO ROBBED",
                "The artist was 🤷‍♂️. not the best singer but a catchy tune",
                "The staging has an animation quality so poor it must be AI-generated. Like, why is it so bad, and why does it go on for so long? Is it intentional? Is this psychological warfare? Am I a casualty? I feel like a casualty.",
                "THIS is the year THIS country qualifies????? With THIS SONG??? What???? We had the same song but [slightly] better, almost-identical chord progressions and all, and now we have to go through it twice in the final!?",
                "I went to the bathroom during that whole nonsense 😂", 
                "This song reminds me of the random English words in anime openings 'because it sounds cool'",
                ":( After all the hype I saw.... once I gave it a listen, it's... okay? Not groundbreaking in the least",
                "My hot take is that this song is bad, it sounds too generic. Why aare the lyrics the most generic phrases 😭",
                "The song is so generic, bland and cliché that it sounds like it's written by an AI, and yet some people argue that It will do well just because of which country sent this. Let's be honest, if it was represented by a country like Denmark or Slovenia and in English, it would've been trashed by the Eurofans",
                "my personal 5th place. Yes, I know it's another vanilla entry, but at least it's a yummy one and in my opinion the best entry in ages. I find the song quite beautiful, but it seems the majority of the fandom doesn't agree with me. Then again, every year, there's always at least one entry which I love that the Eurofans dislike or are indifferent to.",
                "I love a grand dramatic ballad with larger than life Bond-esque vibes & great vocals! It's much better that other crap comprised of fairground pseudotechno beats with childish vocals and lyrics to match, sorry",
                "Serving close to be the worst Maltese entry of the 20s but definitely the second worst", 
                "The jury system is a scam and this proves it.",
                "I just feels it. I might be wrong though but I don't believe it really has a chance to be top 3. Don't see them slaying televoting (probably fairly decent score though).",
                "It's in my top 5. It's a shame I can't vote for it in the semis. I will be praying just like I did for a past entry last year 🤞🤞",
                "Europe wasn’t ready for this absolute masterpiece. This was better than not only the winner this year, but in all years prior.",
                "This sent me to another dimension. It's absolute cinema and anyone who says otherwise is wrong",
                "If this was from Sweden, it would've won.",
                "Over-sexualized entries don't always win people over. People might still like it a lot, but I think it's far from as certain of a top 5 as the odds would have it",
                "This song is a complete mess. A friend from a neighboring country said it was really silly, although it undoubtedly got points from that country",
                "You either love it or you're wrong.",
                "Honestly, I never got the hype around this song. The production is so basic, it's nothing special. Good song, but definitely not winner material. Way too overrated, probably my #15 this year.",
                "Robbed. I don’t care what anyone says—this should’ve qualified. Absolute disgrace.",
                "They gave it everything and still the jury snubbed them. Total daylight robbery.",
                "Okay but why did the staging look like a fever dream? I’m still trying to process it.",
                "With how poorly this did, it's obvious that juries need to be reformed… fishy as last year… How can juries be fair? Saying this for years.",
                "Vocals giving discount Coldplay—can we get a refund?",
                "This had all the drama of a rave and none of the control. A mess in platform shoes.",
                "It sounded like growls and shrieks auditioning for a death metal side act.",
                "Vocals are fine if you squint—I feel like I'm listening underwater.",
                "Unpopular opinion: I freaking love this song and I wanted it to win! People trash talk it only because of where it's from. If an average American singer did it, everyone would eat it up.",
                "Pitchy as heck but confident? Nothing says bold like singing off key at Eurovision.",
                "It’s like someone autotuned a cat fight. Unapologetically chaotic.",
                "I don't get why people like this one so much, a song about a person just saying how awesome they are is incredibly annoying, and I fully relished in seeing them not qualify.",
                "Vocals drowning in synths like a bad karaoke meltdown.",
                "The whole discourse around this song has me rolling my eyes. It's giving me 'people didn't get it' vibes. Twenty years from now, we're going to look back on it as a camp classic and bemoan how serious everyone takes this now.",
                "I'm still salty about how the jury had too much power and this song won over a clear fan favorite with like over half the public vote. Total rigged selection.",
                "This song is sending its country straight back to its darker years. It's the worst. The baby voice is just terrible. What a glow down.",
                "Sing me a ballad? More like sing me flat. Enough already. This belongs in the trash, it's my 35th place",
                "That chorus needed breath control—they were racing the beat and losing.",
                "Everyone's favorite sweaty artist singing a song written by people from another country. Shock qualifier, but I loved it! Energetic performance, even if it missed almost everyone.",
                "I actually had to unfollow people on social media because they called this song 'satanic' and the 'downfall of society.' To me, it was pure art and probably the best overall performance ever. Empowering, actually.",
                "The staging gasped for breath and so did the singer. Literally.",
                "Mic dropped the vocals and apparently forgot to pick them up again.",
                "This isn't singing—it’s a vocal gymnastics fail in glitter form.",
                "Another solo female surrounded by creepy male stalk-dancers—groundbreaking originality, love that for us.",
                "Costume looked torn and dirty, like they raided a dumpster for outfits.",
                "Doing sexy in tourist trap outfits? Fewer crotch grabs, more actual talent please.",
                "The costume felt like a trash bag cosplay stuck in a rave gone wrong.",
                "Too much skin and not enough substance—Eurovision or OnlyFans audition?",
                "Half-naked dancers and no tune—some justification please, Europe!",
                "It’s like every budget ran out except for the wardrobe department.",
                "Stopping for breath in the chorus because outfit was too tight—priorities gone wrong.",
                "That mid-song costume change felt like performance art sabotage.",
                "They delivered a fever dream, then went into a closet with no clothes on stage.",
                "Staging looked like glam goth in a public urinal—uncomfortable art or what?",
                "Tiny dancers everywhere, and yet the song was still invisible.",
                "I saw more naked parts than actual choreography.",
                "When they call it sexy staging and you call it audience offense.",
                "They aimed for shock and landed somewhere between cringe and regret.",
                "That outfit should’ve had a warning label on family TV.",
                "Year after year of bad vocals, but this time every note felt like a war crime.",
                "Can’t hear the live voice—backing track swallowed the singer whole.",
                "The mix buried the main vocal—felt like karaoke with no mic.",
                "Broadcast sounded like someone turned the singer into background noise.",
                "Vocals sounding like fish tank reverb—mixing sabotage, really.",
                "That mix was so bad I thought my TV was cursed.",
                "This song sounded like roadkill—no bass, no energy.",
                "That semi-final performance was so disappointing - no energy, no survival instinct on stage.",
                "Staging tried copying the video but the voice fell flat - always was a meh song.",
                "This performance deserved zero points. Thank Iceland for the pity points.",
                "We deserved at least -10. That was Eurovision sabotage from our country and I'm ashamed.",
                "Vocals locked in a closet and forgotten. Performance drama buried under blandness.",
                "Sending cutesy acts with no soul hasn't worked since 2014— wake UP.",
                "They lit up a blue dress and wiped themselves off the scoreboard.",
                "17th place? That's staging sabotage before the act even started.",
                "Performance looked glittery until the camera cut—then silence.",

                "I’m convinced the jury votes come from a random number generator at this point.",
                "The jury’s decision was so out of touch, I questioned if they even saw the performance.",

                "More creative and daring than most cookie-cutter pop acts we've seen.",
                "This act broke the mold in the best way—sometimes originality wins hearts, not points.",
                "Some called it messy, I called it a breath of fresh air in a sea of sameness.",
                "It was more than a song; it was a statement about embracing the unexpected.",
