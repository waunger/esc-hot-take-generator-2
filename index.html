                "How did this not make it? Arguably the most Eurovision song of them all, with the exception of a couple others. I know it wasn't for everyone but it really threw me through a look because he really did amazing with the performance and imo (plus charisma, stage use, props, etc..)",
                "I feel like it might be because the staging was not 100% as good as the music video. I looooved the song and would've loved to see it in the final but even I was a bit disappointed about what they did on stage - it just fell a bit short after the super fun mv :(",
                "The only good thing about this semifinal was the clock song at the end.",
                "Call me crazy but I think this song gets top 5 in the grand final 😭😭😭.",
                "😬 Sorry guys but now that I've listened and replayed all of the songs, I've started to not like it. I know it's close to his heart but the way they webs their lyrics sound so generic. Their voice just grates me sometimes across the song, too, especially at the repeated part.",
                "This would've won if it had been in Swedish.",
                "JUSTICE FOR THIS SONG! SOOOOOO ROBBED",
                "The artist was 🤷‍♂️. not the best singer but a catchy tune",
                "The staging has an animation quality so poor it must be AI-generated. Like, why is it so bad, and why does it go on for so long? Is it intentional? Is this psychological warfare? Am I a casualty? I feel like a casualty.",
                "THIS is the year THIS country qualifies????? With THIS SONG??? What???? We had the same song but [slightly] better, almost-identical chord progressions and all, and now we have to go through it twice in the final!?",
                "I went to the bathroom during that whole nonsense 😂", 
                "This song reminds me of the random English words in anime openings 'because it sounds cool'",
                ":( After all the hype I saw.... once I gave it a listen, it's... okay? Not groundbreaking in the least",
                "My hot take is that this song is bad, it sounds too generic. Why aare the lyrics the most generic phrases 😭",
                "The song is so generic, bland and cliché that it sounds like it's written by an AI, and yet some people argue that It will do well just because of which country sent this. Let's be honest, if it was represented by a country like Denmark or Slovenia and in English, it would've been trashed by the Eurofans",
                "my personal 5th place. Yes, I know it's another vanilla entry, but at least it's a yummy one and in my opinion the best entry in ages. I find the song quite beautiful, but it seems the majority of the fandom doesn't agree with me. Then again, every year, there's always at least one entry which I love that the Eurofans dislike or are indifferent to.",
                "I love a grand dramatic ballad with larger than life Bond-esque vibes & great vocals! It's much better that other crap comprised of fairground pseudotechno beats with childish vocals and lyrics to match, sorry",
                "Serving close to be the worst Maltese entry of the 20s but definitely the second worst", 
                "The jury system is a scam and this proves it.",
                "I just feels it. I might be wrong though but I don't believe it really has a chance to be top 3. Don't see them slaying televoting (probably fairly decent score though).",
                "It's in my top 5. It's a shame I can't vote for it in the semis. I will be praying just like I did for a past entry last year 🤞🤞",
                "Europe wasn’t ready for this absolute masterpiece. This was better than not only the winner this year, but in all years prior.",
                "This sent me to another dimension. It's absolute cinema and anyone who says otherwise is wrong",
                "If this was from Sweden, it would've won.",
                "Over-sexualized entries don't always win people over. People might still like it a lot, but I think it's far from as certain of a top 5 as the odds would have it",
                "This song is a complete mess. A friend from a neighboring country said it was really silly, although it undoubtedly got points from that country",
                "You either love it or you're wrong.",
                "Honestly, I never got the hype around this song. The production is so basic, it's nothing special. Good song, but definitely not winner material. Way too overrated, probably my #15 this year.",
                "Robbed. I don’t care what anyone says—this should’ve qualified. Absolute disgrace.",
                "They gave it everything and still the jury snubbed them. Total daylight robbery.",
                "Okay but why did the staging look like a fever dream? I’m still trying to process it.",
                "With how poorly this did, it's obvious that juries need to be reformed… fishy as last year… How can juries be fair? Saying this for years.",
                "Vocals giving discount Coldplay—can we get a refund?",
                "This had all the drama of a rave and none of the control. A mess in platform shoes.",
                "It sounded like growls and shrieks auditioning for a death metal side act.",
                "Vocals are fine if you squint—I feel like I'm listening underwater.",
                "Unpopular opinion: I freaking love this song and I wanted it to win! People trash talk it only because of where it's from. If an average American singer did it, everyone would eat it up.",
                "Pitchy as heck but confident? Nothing says bold like singing off key at Eurovision.",
                "It’s like someone autotuned a cat fight. Unapologetically chaotic.",
                "I don't get why people like this one so much, a song about a person just saying how awesome they are is incredibly annoying, and I fully relished in seeing them not qualify.",
                "Vocals drowning in synths like a bad karaoke meltdown.",
                "The whole discourse around this song has me rolling my eyes. It's giving me 'people didn't get it' vibes. Twenty years from now, we're going to look back on it as a camp classic and bemoan how serious everyone takes this now.",
                "I'm still salty about how the jury had too much power and this song won over a clear fan favorite with like over half the public vote. Total rigged selection.",
                "This song is sending its country straight back to its darker years. It's the worst. The baby voice is just terrible. What a glow down.",
                "Sing me a ballad? More like sing me flat. Enough already. This belongs in the trash, it's my 35th place",
                "That chorus needed breath control—they were racing the beat and losing.",
                "Everyone's favorite sweaty artist singing a song written by people from another country. Shock qualifier, but I loved it! Energetic performance, even if it missed almost everyone.",
                "I actually had to unfollow people on social media because they called this song 'satanic' and the 'downfall of society.' To me, it was pure art and probably the best overall performance ever. Empowering, actually.",
                "The staging gasped for breath and so did the singer. Literally.",
                "Mic dropped the vocals and apparently forgot to pick them up again.",
                "This isn't singing—it’s a vocal gymnastics fail in glitter form.",
                "Another solo female surrounded by creepy male stalk-dancers—groundbreaking originality, love that for us.",
                "Costume looked torn and dirty, like they raided a dumpster for outfits.",
                "Doing sexy in tourist trap outfits? Fewer crotch grabs, more actual talent please.",
                "The costume felt like a trash bag cosplay stuck in a rave gone wrong.",
                "Too much skin and not enough substance—Eurovision or OnlyFans audition?",
                "Half-naked dancers and no tune—some justification please, Europe!",
                "It’s like every budget ran out except for the wardrobe department.",
                "Stopping for breath in the chorus because outfit was too tight—priorities gone wrong.",
                "That mid-song costume change felt like performance art sabotage.",
                "They delivered a fever dream, then went into a closet with no clothes on stage.",
                "Staging looked like glam goth in a public urinal—uncomfortable art or what?",
                "Tiny dancers everywhere, and yet the song was still invisible.",
                "I saw more naked parts than actual choreography.",
                "When they call it sexy staging and you call it audience offense.",
                "They aimed for shock and landed somewhere between cringe and regret.",
                "That outfit should’ve had a warning label on family TV.",
                "Year after year of bad vocals, but this time every note felt like a war crime.",
                "Can’t hear the live voice—backing track swallowed the singer whole.",
                "The mix buried the main vocal—felt like karaoke with no mic.",
                "Broadcast sounded like someone turned the singer into background noise.",
                "Vocals sounding like fish tank reverb—mixing sabotage, really.",
                "That mix was so bad I thought my TV was cursed.",
                "This song sounded like roadkill—no bass, no energy.",
                "That semi-final performance was so disappointing - no energy, no survival instinct on stage.",
                "Staging tried copying the video but the voice fell flat - always was a meh song.",
                "This performance deserved zero points. Thank Iceland for the pity points.",
                "We deserved at least -10. That was Eurovision sabotage from our country and I'm ashamed.",
                "Vocals locked in a closet and forgotten. Performance drama buried under blandness.",
                "Sending cutesy acts with no soul hasn't worked since 2014— wake UP.",
                "They lit up a blue dress and wiped themselves off the scoreboard.",
                "17th place? That's staging sabotage before the act even started.",
                "Performance looked glittery until the camera cut—then silence.",

                "That choreography screamed ‘last minute panic’ and ‘no rehearsals ever’ at full volume.",
                "The only thing coordinated was the audience’s collective eye roll at the cringey stage antics.",
                "Did they mistake this for a music video or a circus? Because the staging was a three-ring disaster.",
                "The dancers’ energy was in a different time zone—probably asleep or on vacation during the show.",
                "The lighting tried to save it, but bad moves and worse staging left it drowning in neon regret.",
                "This looked like a rehearsal tape someone accidentally broadcasted. Eurovision deserves better.",

                "I muted the sound and just stared in disbelief. That was Eurovision? No thanks.",

                "This was robbed harder than any contestant in history. I’m still screaming into the void.",
                "The only injustice here is that this gem didn’t make it to the final. Absolutely gutted.",
                "They should’ve been a top contender, but nope—Eurovision voters clearly don’t know quality.",
                "I’m still baffled and furious that this didn’t get through. What a slap in the face to real talent.",
                "If this can’t qualify, what hope is there for genuine artistry on that stage?",
                "Eurovision just gave a big middle finger to every fan who believed in this song.",
                "This deserved the final spotlight, not to be buried in the semis. Unforgivable.",
                "It’s like they purposely snubbed the best act just to stir controversy. I’m done.",
                "Still can’t believe the juries and viewers let this slip through. It’s a travesty.",
                "The staging was fire, the vocals were impeccable, and they still got dumped. Madness.",
                "They killed it live and still didn’t qualify? Somebody explain this injustice now.",
                "If this isn’t proof Eurovision voters don’t get it, I don’t know what is.",
                "I’m raging over here because this song was robbed of the chance it deserved.",
                "Every time I think about this non-qualification, I want to scream at my screen.",
                "The jury must’ve been asleep or on vacation during that performance—how else do you explain this nonsense?",
                "Can someone explain the jury’s logic? Because I’m seriously lost in the sauce here.",
                "The jury’s voting felt like a bad joke, and we’re all the punchline.",
                "Are the juries watching the same show as the rest of us? Because this verdict is straight-up baffling.",
                "The jury clearly has different taste buds—this was robbed in front of our eyes.",
                "I’m convinced the jury votes come from a random number generator at this point.",
                "The jury’s decision was so out of touch, I questioned if they even saw the performance.",
                "The jury voted like they were punishing the artist for existing. What was that about?",
                "Seriously, how does the jury overlook pure talent like that? It’s beyond me.",
                "If the jury’s goal was to confuse and frustrate fans, then mission accomplished.",
                "Jury votes felt like a power move to tank the competition. I’m not here for this drama.",
                "The jury missed the point entirely, and the fans are left picking up the pieces.",
                "How do you give zero points to a performance that moved the entire arena? Jury, explain yourself.",
                "The jury’s votes are a mystery wrapped in a riddle soaked in pure nonsense.",
                "The jury completely butchered the results—this is Eurovision sabotage, plain and simple.",
                "This song’s only win was a political free pass. Zero talent, 100% nepotism.",
                "Eurovision’s supposed to celebrate music, not political alliances disguised as votes.",
                "Qualified because of diplomatic favors, not because anyone actually liked it. Sad.",
                "The moment politics takes over Eurovision, the contest officially jumps the shark.",
                "I’m done with political voting ruining the magic and fairness of the competition.",
                "This song got through by riding the coattails of politics—nothing else.",
                "The jury and televote turned Eurovision into a political battleground, and this song is proof.",
                "When political voting outshines talent, it’s time to rethink the entire contest.",
                "This qualification is a slap to every artist who actually earned their spot with talent.",
                "They didn’t qualify on merit—they qualified on political favors and strategic voting.",
                "Eurovision, once a music contest, now a political circus where talent is optional.",
                "Watching politics decide the winner is why I’m losing faith in Eurovision.",
                "This political save was a disgrace to the fans who voted for real music.",
                "The best songs get snubbed while politics hands out freebies like candy.",
                "If you want politics, watch the news—not Eurovision. This is a betrayal of fans.",
                "I’m shook that they did so well, especially seeing they were middling in their semi final... I will never understand why some songs click with the public!",
                "You can keep your chart-toppers—I’ll forever stan this masterpiece that actually *means* something.",
                "Call it a flop all you want, but this song is pure art and every note hits like a dagger in the soul.",
                "They didn’t win, but that’s because the masses lack the taste to recognize true genius.",
                "This song didn’t just sing—it *preached*. If you can’t feel that, maybe check your pulse.",
                "Overrated pop is a dime a dozen. This underdog carried the torch for REAL music.",
                "I will shout from the rooftops: this is the crown jewel of Eurovision heartbreak anthems.",
                "It’s not for the faint-hearted—only true fans get the depth and emotion packed in every second.",
                "Flopped? Nah, it *disrupted* the contest and shattered all your tired expectations.",
                "It’s a cult classic waiting to be discovered by the enlightened few who crave substance.",
                "Every time this song plays, it’s a reminder that Eurovision deserves more than just flashy gimmicks.",
                "You’re sleeping on a hurricane wrapped in a ballad—wake up before it’s too late.",
                "Haters will say it’s mediocre, but I’ll defend this song with my last breath.",
                "It’s a slow burn, a hidden gem, and one day it’ll be hailed as a masterpiece.",
                "This track didn’t just compete—it *owned* the stage in a way no one else dared to.",
                "Mark my words: this song is the truest expression of Eurovision’s heart and soul.",
                "Love the staging and outfits but the song is meh. Maybe it was just too early in the running order?",
                "People slept on this, but the songwriting and vibe were way ahead of its time.",
                "They didn’t win, but that voice could move mountains—absolute underrated talent.",
                "The staging was minimal, but it let the raw vocals shine through beautifully.",
                "Overlooked by many, cherished by those who appreciate true artistry.",
                "Sometimes numbers don’t tell the whole story—this song was proof.",
                "An emotional rollercoaster that deserved to make more waves.",
                "Flop in points, gem in my playlist—this song grew on me every replay.",
                "It lacked spectacle but had authenticity in spades—can’t fake that.",
                "The perfect blend of melancholy and hope, completely misunderstood by juries.",
                "More than a song—it was a story told with passion and sincerity.",
                "This was a diamond in the rough, shining bright when you actually listened.",
                "They took a risk and delivered a performance unlike anything else—bold and memorable.",
                "Not everyone's cup of tea, but I loved the quirky energy and uniqueness.",
                "Finally, a band that dared to be weird and didn’t just follow the usual Eurovision formula.",
                "The song was a wild ride—fun, chaotic, and impossible to forget.",
                "It might have missed the mark for many, but it made me smile every time.",
                "More creative and daring than most cookie-cutter pop acts we've seen.",
                "This act broke the mold in the best way—sometimes originality wins hearts, not points.",
                "Some called it messy, I called it a breath of fresh air in a sea of sameness.",
                "It was more than a song; it was a statement about embracing the unexpected.",
                "While not mainstream, it’s a cult classic in the making for those who appreciate bold artistry.",
                "They may not have scored well, but they definitely left a mark on the contest.",
                "Loved the eccentric vibes and the storytelling—it wasn’t for everyone, but it was for me.",
                "Underappreciated gem with so much character and personality.",
                "This masterpiece *should’ve* won back in the golden era—Eurovision sold its soul chasing trends.",
                "They didn’t stand a chance against today’s noise—but back in the ‘90s, this would’ve *slayed*.",
                "If this had dropped in the 2000s, it’d be the anthem every fan worships to this day. Fight me.",
                "This track is a *time traveler*—ahead by decades while the rest stumble in the dark.",
                "A relic of the future stuck in the past—Eurovision just wasn’t ready for this level of genius.",
                "Everyone’s stuck chasing flash and gimmicks, but this song had *real* soul way before its time.",
                "You think it flopped? No, it was *misunderstood* by a world not evolved enough to get it.",
                "Put this on a ‘90s playlist and watch it light up every club—Eurovision blew it, big time.",
                "This song was a prophet, and Eurovision ignored the prophecy. Mark my words, it’ll be revered.",
                "In a different era, this would’ve sparked a revolution, not a controversy. Absolute legend.",
                "You can’t fake this kind of timeless magic—Eurovision’s taste just wasn’t on the level.",
                "It was so far ahead that it crashed the Eurovision matrix. People just weren’t ready.",
                "I’d fight a legion of trolls defending this as one of the greatest songs Eurovision *never* properly appreciated.",
                "This is not a flop—it’s a *misaligned masterpiece* that would’ve reshaped the contest if given the chance.",
                "Forget the scoreboard—this song is a piece of history that only future generations will truly get.",
                "This was pure chaos and charm—snubbed and overlooked like every underrated classic before it.",
                "This was robbed on an epic scale. The staging was next level, vocals were tight, and they still didn’t make it?!",
                "I was ready to crown them as a winner, but apparently, the rest of Eurovision didn’t get the memo.",
                "Watching them get left behind was the biggest insult to fans this decade. Unacceptable.",
                "This song was an absolute banger and got tossed aside like trash. This contest has officially lost the plot.",
